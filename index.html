<p>This is a simple location project, which contains a <a href="https://github.com/slproject/client">client</a>, written in PhoneGap (and thus, being able to be deployed to many mobile platforms) and a <a href="https://github.com/slproject/server">server</a>, written in pure PHP.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, both client and server has nasty bugs placed so deeply in core code, that to fix it, entire project would actually have to be rewritten from scratch. I don't have time to do so and I don't plan to do it. That is, why you should <strong>treat this project just as a toy</strong>, a funny experiment or an introduction to writing your own solution. You shouldn't <strong>absolutely</strong> use it in production environment or for any kind of serious location or tracking issues.</p>

<p>More information about this project and its both components, you'll find in <a href="https://github.com/slproject/client">client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/slproject/server">server</a> repositories.</p>
