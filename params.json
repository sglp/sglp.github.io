{"name":"Simple Location Project","tagline":"Simple client and server for tracking your mobile devices","body":"# Simple Location Project\r\n\r\nThis is a simple location project, which contains a [client](https://github.com/slproject/client), written in PhoneGap (and thus, being able to be deployed to many mobile platforms) and a [server](https://github.com/slproject/server), written in pure PHP.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, both client and server has nasty bugs placed so deeply in core code, that to fix it, entire project would actually have to be rewritten from scratch. I don't have time to do so and I don't plan to do it. That is, why you should **treat this project just as a toy**, a funny experiment or an introduction to writing your own solution. You shouldn't **absolutely** use it in production environment or for any kind of serious location or tracking issues.\r\n\r\nMore information about this project and its both components, you'll find in [client](https://github.com/slproject/client) and [server](https://github.com/slproject/server) repositories.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
